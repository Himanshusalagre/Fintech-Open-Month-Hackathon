### ..A webapp for connecting startups & Investors at one place.

The problem Investment spot solves: 

These days the startup culture is very much boosting in India, Some of them may not be able to gain investors due to various reasons. Hence there is a need for a platform which will be connecting investors and startups and fill the communication gap between them.

Especially the startups in rural areas fail due to lack of funding & resources hence there is need of proper guidance and knowledge. Hence there is a requirement for a platform which will not only provide them guidance but also promote them, due to which investors' eyes can catch them. 

Investment spot will be a web based platform to connect & support such startups with the investors so they can get good returns on investment and will be a win-win situation for both of them.
